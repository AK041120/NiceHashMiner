Introduction
------------

This plugin displays a custom dialog that looks like a small installing dialog.
This plugin was originally coded for the InstallSpider user interface, but can
be used in any installer. Update in November 2010 added the cool blue smooth bar
with colour changing percent display like the old installers. Update in June 2016
added support for changing the icon.

Functions
---------

There are only three functions in this plugin. 'Show' and 'ShowPBOnly' must
be called in a section.

SpiderBanner::Show [POS DIST] [/MODERN] [/ICON FILENAME]

All flags are optional. Except for /MODERN, all flags can be used multiple
times, only the last one takes effect. Processing stops at the first unknown
flag, and it stays on the stack along with any following flags, valid or not.

POS is the position of the dialog, DIST is the distance from the corner
specified in pixels. Must be called in this order.
/TL	     Top Left corner
/TR	     Top Right corner
/BL	     Bottom Left corner
/BR      Bottom Right corner
/CENTER  Center the dialog. DIST is not valid for this flag. This is the default if the
         input doesn't match any in the list, even nothing defaults to /CENTER.

/MODERN  Shows the standard Windows progressbar instead.

/ICON    Sets a custom icon for the banner. FILENAME must be quoted. If the file does
         not exist, the installers icon will be used instead.

If the commandline is like this:

SpiderBanner::Show /MODERN /BR 48

It means that the dialog will be placed 48 pixels up and left from the bottom
right hand corner with a standard windows progress bar.

SpiderBanner::Show /TL 100

It means that the dialog will be placed 100 pixels down and right from the top
left hand corner with the custom progress bar.

SpiderBanner::ShowPBOnly

This changes the progress bar on the main installer window. Doesn't require any flags.

SpiderBanner::Destroy

Destroys the dialog and restores the original size of the installer. You can call this
at any time in your installer. This is automatically called when the installer closes.
